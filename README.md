# DnD 5e Encounter Calculator

The DnD 5e Encounter Calculator can determine the Challenge Rating of an adventuring party provided by user input and display a list of monsters that will provide an even match to the party.

The DnD 5e Encounter Calculator will streamline encounter building for Dungeon Masters everywhere.

## Code Kentucky Requirements

**Feature 1**
- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
This is accomplished with several while loops allowing for the creation of a different adventuring party without closing the program.


**Feature 2**
- Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams).
This is accomplished by converting the list of adventurer levels into the Challenge rating equivilent for the party.


**Feature 3**
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
This is acomplished by the twenty-four lists of monsters divided into groups by challenge rating and displayed after a matching challenge rating party is created.

## Getting Started

1) Clone Project
2) Run in From Visual Studio
3) Use number keys for most actions

## To Do
-[  ] Add call to an api in order to display the stats of the monsters(Feature was delayed due to time constraints).
